      scripture: "Psalm 23\n\n1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.\n2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,\n3 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.\n4 Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\n5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.\n6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

      scripture: "Matthew 5:1-16 (The Sermon on the Mount Begins)\n\n1 Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,\n2 and he began to teach them. He said:\n3 \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.\n5 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.\n6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.\n7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.\n8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.\n9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\n10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n11 Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.\n12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.\n14 You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.\n15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.\n16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\""

      scripture: "John 15:1-17 (The Vine and the Branches)\n\n1 \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.\n2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.\n3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.\n4 Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.\n5 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\n6 If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.\n7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.\n8 This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.\n9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.\n10 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love.\n11 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.\n12 My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\n13 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.\n14 You are my friends if you do what I command.\n15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.\n16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.\n17 This is my command: Love each other.\""

      scripture: "Isaiah 40:1-31 (Comfort and Hope)\n\n1 Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.\n2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.\n3 A voice of one calling: \"In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\n4 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.\n5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.\"\n...\n28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.\n29 He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.\n30 Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;\n31 but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."

      scripture: "1 Corinthians 13:1-13 (The Love Chapter)\n\n1 If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.\n2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.\n3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.\n4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.\n5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.\n6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.\n7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\n8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.\n9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,\n10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.\n11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.\n12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\n13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

      scripture: "Romans 8:1-39 (Freedom in Christ)\n\n1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,\n2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.\n3 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,\n4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\n...\n28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.\n29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.\n30 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.\n31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\n32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\n33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.\n34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.\n35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?\n36 As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\"\n37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.\n38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,\n39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

      scripture: "Philippians 4:1-23 (Rejoice in the Lord)\n\n1 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!\n2 I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.\n3 Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.\n4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!\n5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.\n6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\n7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n8 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.\n9 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.\n10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.\n11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.\n12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.\n13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength.\n14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.\n15 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;\n16 for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need.\n17 Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account.\n18 I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.\n19 And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.\n20 To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n21 Greet all God's people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.\n22 All God's people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household.\n23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."

      scripture: "Revelation 21:1-27 (The New Heaven and the New Earth)\n\n1 Then I saw \"a new heaven and a new earth,\" for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.\n2 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.\n3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \"Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.\n4 'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\"\n5 He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\"\n6 He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.\n7 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.\n8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\"\n9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\"\n10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.\n11 It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.\n12 It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.\n13 There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.\n14 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\n15 The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.\n16 The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.\n17 The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick.\n18 The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.\n19 The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,\n20 the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.\n21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.\n22 I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.\n23 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.\n24 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.\n25 On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.\n26 The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.\n27 Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life."
